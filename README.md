Apiti is a personal project to create a money management app, with features being added gradually over time.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Background

I was searching for a money management app on websites and Android but didn't find one that satisfied my requirements. None of the apps I tried had the function to create a daily limit budget, store the remaining amount if the daily limit was not reached, and cumulate it to the next day to increase the daily limit. It was this absence of this feature that motivated me to create Apiti. I plan to add features gradually, allowing the development process to begin as soon as possible.

### Behind The Scene

- Brainstorming the ideas.
